<h1 class="header">AWS Code of Conduct 2026</h1>

<p>
We ask you to be welcoming, respectful, and generous towards all participants and
recognize that it is your responsibility to ensure that your actions match your intent.
Discriminatory, exclusionary, bullying or harassing behavior will not be tolerated. This
applies to the lecture room, refreshment area, evening sessions, hotel and other places
not part of the official program.
</p>

<p>
Examples of harassment include but are not limited to:
<ul>
<li>offensive comments (including those related to gender, age, sexual orientation,
disability, physical appearance, body size, race and religion);</li>
<li>deliberate intimidation or following;</li>
<li>harassing photography or recording;</li>
<li>sustained disruption of talks or other events;</li>
<li>inappropriate physical contact;</li>
<li>unwelcome sexual or other forms of attention.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
In the event that you witness or experience inappropriate behavior, please inform the
organizers and, if you feel comfortable, intervene to stop it. The organizers will keep all
information about such complaints confidential, and our resulting actions will be done in
consultation with the offended party. In particular, no action will be taken without their
consent, and so such fears should not be a deterrent to reporting. An anonymous link will be made available closer to the start of the program.
</p>

<p>
Failure to follow the code of conduct could result in you being barred from the event and
future winter school programming.
